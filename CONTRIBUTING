Contributing to this project
============================

There are many ways to contribute to this project, with the most common ones
being contribution of code or documentation to the project. Improving the
documentation is no less important than improving the library itself. If you
find a typo in the documentation, or have made improvements, do not hesitate to
send an email to the authors or preferably submit a GitHub pull request.

But there are many other ways to help. In particular answering queries on the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/quentinhaenn/jdd/issues),
investigating bugs, and [reviewing other developers' pull
requests](https://github.com/quentinhaenn/jdd/pulls)
are very valuable contributions that decrease the burden on the project
maintainers.

Another way to contribute is to report issues you're facing, and give a "thumbs
up" on issues that others reported and that are relevant to you.
